    "I used python and numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:\n",

    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed according to the sign classes, that is, each bar stands for a class and its height represents the number of images of this class. As you can see, the dataset is not uniformly distributed. This could give rise to a bias in the predictions of our CNN.\n",

    "#### 2. 1. Describe how, and identify where in your code, you preprocessed the image data. What tecniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second cell of this section, we define the necessary functions to pre-process the data. In this case, we only pre-process the images normalizing them (normalize(X)). The normalization function chosen was that present in this [lab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/lab.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that I decided not to convert the images to grayscale. This decision was made because the meaning of a traffic sign is pretty related with its color. Moreover I made some trials with grayscale images and the validation accuracy was a bit lower than that achieved considering the 3 channels of color. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I have tested the performance trimming the image with the help of the [bounding box coordinates](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) provided in the data set (coord_train = train['coords']). However, I decided to discard this technique because in Step 3, images not belonging to the German Traffic Sign Dataset don't have this coordinates available. Then, I won't be able to run the same preprocessing with them.\n",

    "As explained in the first section, the inequality in the number of occurrencies of each class in the training set can give rise to a bad performance. That's why I decided to augment the data to make uniform this distribution. The code to augment the data can be seen in the second cell of the step 2 section.

Then, I decided to work with colored images and thus I had to change the input shape for the first layer. Afterwards, I increased the number of filters in each convolutional layer so that the CNN were able to pick up different qualities of an image. Once I had got an acceptable validation accuracy, I applied dropout after the second fully connected layer in order to avoid the overfitting and, that way, achieve a test accuracy pretty similar to the validation accuracy.\n",

It seems like the model can detect it is a speed limit but has trouble identifying the difference between the values in the sign. There are some errors in the middle zone too. These are warning signs with triangular shape related with pedestrians and animals.\n",

    "\n",
    "The accuracy achieved with the developed CNN is quite good and the results indicate that there is not overfitting. However, they could possibly be even better with another model structure using inception layers for example. However, I think that the best improvement would come with a deeper preprocessing of the images. As said in section 1, the german traffic signs dataset includes bounding box coordinates. If we trimmed the images by this bounding box the accuracy would be increased. The problem is that images not coming from that dataset do not have this coordinates available, so that, we would have to develop a method to find them and then trim the images.\n",
